This repository demonstrates a common error in Firebase applications where a type mismatch occurs when accessing data. The `bug.js` file showcases the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` provides a solution to handle potential type mismatches and prevent unexpected behavior.  The issue arises from inconsistent data types received from Firebase compared to what's expected in the application logic.
