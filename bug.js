The Firebase SDK may throw an error if the data you're trying to access is not in the format expected. For example, if you're expecting a string but receive a number, or if you're expecting an object but receive an array, this can lead to unexpected crashes or incorrect behavior. This is especially prevalent when dealing with data fetched from a database, or when integrating with other libraries that might have different data structures.
